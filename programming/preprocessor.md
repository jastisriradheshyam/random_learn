# Preprocessor

Preprocessor generates final source code to be compiled from existing source code which incudes preprocessor directives.

The problem with preprocessor is that it may alter logic and semantics of the original code as preprocessor does not know about underlying language or syntax, and may cause issues during debugging if issue persists.

## Programming languages with a preprocessor
- C and C++
  - called directives/pragmas and begin with `#`
  - they are not part of  C programming language syntax.
- Ada
- PL/SQL
