# Programming Language Assessment

Following is the list of parameters and features that we should assess the programming language (or framework based on the language e.g. NodeJS) to know it's the right fit for us.

- control flow
  - Looping constructs
  - conditional statements / flow
- Error handling patterns
- test case (at least unit test case support)
