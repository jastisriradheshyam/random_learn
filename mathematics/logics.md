# Logics

- Tautology: Logical formula which is true in every possible interpretation
  - Example: "x=y or xâ‰ y". Similarly, "either the ball is green, or the ball is not green" is always true, regardless of the colour of the ball.
  - borrowed from rhetoric, where a tautology is a repetitive statement.
