## Main state machine

- various computations pertaining to transactions submitted by users to the Polygon zkEVM network
- generates fixed-length, easy-to-verify cryptographic proofs of Computational Integrity (CI).
  - These proofs can be verified by spending only a minimal amount of computational resources.
  - these proofs are **STARK** proofs that are recursively aggregated into one **STARK** proof, which is in turn proved with a **SNARK** proof

## zk friendly hash

STARK-friendly hash functions (SFH) are hash functions which are specified as a sequence of low-degree polynomials or low-degree rational maps over a finite field

## Comparisions

- Rescue vs Poseidon
  - https://ethresear.ch/t/performance-of-rescue-and-poseidon-hash-functions/7161
    - These results are from for Intel Core i5-7300U @ 2.60GHz (single thread):
      - Rescue: ~12,000 hashes/second or ~80,000 ns / hash
      - Poseidon: ~33,000 hashes/second or ~30,000 ns / hash

There are multiple hash functions designed for ZK-proof systems. Poseidon is an
efficient hash function that is widely used. The partial layers in the design of Poseidon were subject
to multiple attacks [KR21a, BCD+20] subsequently leading to updating the parameters. Recently,
in [ABM23a] the authors analyzed the security of Poseidon and showed that in some synthetic cases,
the number of rounds proposed for providing a specific security level is insufficient. In the same work,
the authors showed some flaws in the security proof of Poseidon. Recently, a new version of Poseidon,
called Poseidon2 [GKS23] was published to improve the efficiency of Poseidon but without correcting
the flaws found in the security arguments.
