# Blockchain

- In a blockchain, data is organized into blocks, and each block contains a set of transactions or other data that has been validated and added to the chain.

- Each block in the blockchain contains a reference to the previous block in the chain, which creates a sequential and linked structure of blocks. This structure ensures that the data stored in the blockchain is tamper-evident, as any attempt to modify a block would require modifying all subsequent blocks in the chain.
