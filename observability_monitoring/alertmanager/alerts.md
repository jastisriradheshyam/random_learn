# Alerts

# Predict linear

- `predict_linear` function will predict data based on previous trends [2] [3]
  - `predict_linear(node_filesystem_free_bytes{job="node"}[1h], 4 * 3600) < 0`
    - here based on past 1 hour trend, we can check the value after 4 hours and 
      if value is less then 0 then we can say free space will be utilized within 4 hours.
