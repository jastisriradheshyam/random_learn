# Software Observability introduction

- 

- Observability has to be engineered specific to each programming language or framework.
  - This specificity arises due to the fact that internals have to invoked during instrumentation of the given system.

- For good Observability application code must emit signals such as traces, metrics, and logs. [2]
  - The emitted data as traces, metrics and logs are known as Telemetry data.

## Tools

- Dtrace
  - processes data in situ
- Googleâ€™s Sawzall [1]
  - post-processes data

## Keywords

- instrumentation
