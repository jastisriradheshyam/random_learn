# Test runner

- testing can be done by importing the package `node:test` and passing `--test` argument in node command (Working without argument)
- for assertion use `node:assert`


- Module Interception : `proxyquire` / `esmock`
- Spying and stubbing : `sinon`
- Standalone snapshot : `snapshot-assertion`

- `Promise` rejections, `error` throwing, and `done` callback not being invoked will result in failure of the test case
