# Practices

## Code review through MR / PR (**A perspective**)

- PR / MR concepts been popularized by Open Source projects where one may not trust the other person's code.
- In a company working on same code base by team members should have same commit / process level access as lead or manager unless the member is junior / person new to the project. Even Juniors should have their access elevated as soon as possible based on their commit quality.
- The review can be done during pair programming with the team. (not sure how effective this is)
