# Least Disruptive Subrange

```
what would be the least sum of differences between elements of two lists when second list is replacing the few of the first list elements.
first : [1,2,3,4,5]
second: [4,4,5]

Here it would be last three elements can be replaces with second list with least disruption
abs(3-4) + abs(4-4) + abs(5-5) = 1
```
