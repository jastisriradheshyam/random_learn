# Array

- Static array
  - Single type fixed size allocation
- Dynamic arrays
  - Single type (can be multi type) and array length can be shrunk and grown as we add or remove elements 
- Multi type arrays
  - Multiple type of elements in a single array structure


## Complexity (mostly for single type arrays)

- Traversing : O(n)
- Updating at an index: O(1)
- Deleting at an index: O(n)
  - Due to shifting of array
- Inserting at an index: O(n) 
  - Due to shifting of array
- Accessing a element at an index: O(1)
